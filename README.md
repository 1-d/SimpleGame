# SimpleGame

This a grade 12 computer science project, completed on January 19, 2017.

The final .jar file is `SimpleGame.jar`, which can be found in the main project folder. It takes around 8 minutes to complete the game, assuming that you don't die.

If you're curious, this project got 100%. Just like [this](https://github.com/TT1103/100-The-Dream) project.

You may take ideas from the code now. :)
